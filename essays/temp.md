## A Structure
Design patterns are structured template solutions for software engineering problems that you can follow. I see it as the foundation of your software solution that you should build upon. It is like part of the skeleton that keeps your body together.    

## Why so strict?
Although I agree that there should be a set of coding standards, I do not believe that they should be extremely strict. To elaborate, I feel like programmers should have the freedom use any type of style they wish, (ie. camel case, underscore case, Allman style, K&R style, etc), but still have a common ground of what are good programming practices and what aren't. To analogize, think about people writing in English, anyone can write in any style they want, comic-sans, script, etc., however everyone must follow the same spelling and grammatical rules established in the English standard. In other words, I believe that you can use any coding style you're comfortable with, however your code better not look like something that just came fresh out of The Old Spaghetti Factory's kitchen.
