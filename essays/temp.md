## A Structure for your Program
Design patterns are structured template solutions for software engineering problems that you can follow. I see it as the overview of your software solution that you should follow and build upon similar to a simple diagrams that you see in textbooks. They are there to give a visual representation of the bare bone structure of your program. They show basic interactions and relationships of classes and objects which can be used repeatedly for different types of software programming solutions.          

## Why so strict?
Although I agree that there should be a set of coding standards, I do not believe that they should be extremely strict. To elaborate, I feel like programmers should have the freedom use any type of style they wish, (ie. camel case, underscore case, Allman style, K&R style, etc), but still have a common ground of what are good programming practices and what aren't. To analogize, think about people writing in English, anyone can write in any style they want, comic-sans, script, etc., however everyone must follow the same spelling and grammatical rules established in the English standard. In other words, I believe that you can use any coding style you're comfortable with, however your code better not look like something that just came fresh out of The Old Spaghetti Factory's kitchen.
