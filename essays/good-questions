Learning is a natural phenomenon that we as humans experience one way or another. We are constantly learning about new things everyday whether they're complex mathematical equations or simple cooking recipes. Over the course of my life, I have faced many obstacles that I would have never been able to get over alone. There were countless moments where I have struggled to figure something out and ultimately needed to seek for help from my peers. In order for me to understand and learn things, I must struggle through it first and try every method that would lead me closer to the solution. Once I have exhausted all my options, only then would I ask questions to hopefully guide me to the solution. Learning how to ask proper questions is also crucial to my learning experience and respectful to other people's time and consideration.
