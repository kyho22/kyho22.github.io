## First Impressions on Javascript
  Currently, I think Javascript is a really clean language to use. When I first started doing the Javascript code camp exercises, I noticed that it like C; the syntax was very similar to C therefore I was able to grasp the language pretty quickly. As I am doing these training excercises, I immediately noticed that datatypes were non-existent. It took some time for me to train my hands not to put the datatype down as I'm declaring a variable but eventually I got used to it. Javascript felt very familiar to me because I had some experience with C and C++, and I am eager to learn more about what the language is capable of doing.  
  
## My opinion on the language
  After fiddling with Javascript for about a week, I have mixed feelings about it. I like how we don't have to worry about datatypes however
