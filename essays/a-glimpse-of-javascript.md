## First Impressions on Javascript  
  Currently, I think Javascript is a really clean language to use. When I first started doing the Javascript code camp exercises, I noticed that it's like C; the syntax was very similar to C therefore I was able to grasp the language fairly quickly. As I am doing these training exercises, I immediately noticed that you don't have to state the datatype of a variable as you're declaring it. It took some time for me to train my hands not to put the datatype down as I'm declaring a variable but eventually I got used to it. In general, Javascript felt very familiar to me because I had some experience with C and C++, and I am eager to learn more about what the language is capable of doing.  
  
## My opinion on the language  
  After fiddling with Javascript for about a week, I have mixed feelings about it. I like how we don't have to worry about datatypes however I am worried that in the future, there might be a bug that is caused by an underlying datatype issue and I would imagine that it would not be a great time to fix. I feel like Javascript is a really good beginner language to learn from a software engineering perspective. It should be used to give people a taste of what programming is like and to see if they are interested in the field. If they do like it, I think people should build their foundation in programming through Javascript, then branch out and explore what other languages has to offer and experience the wonderful thing we know as programming.        
  
## Workout of the Day (WODs)  
  This programming class is very unique in a way that it puts you under stress every week and tests your ability to program under pressure. I feel like the WODs are an excellent way of learning a programming language because it gives you lots of practice with it. The WODs are indeed very stressful, however they are also very enjoyable because it is extremely rewarded whenever you're able to tackle it down. The practice WODs are also really helpful because they give you a general idea of what the actual WOD is going to be about. To me, the WODs reminds me of working as an expo in a busy restaurant. You're on a time limit for every customer orders and you have to make sure that every dish that leaves the kitchen is correct and presentable. On top of that, you can't slow down or make any mistakes because there are more orders flooding in and you have to keep track of how long each customer has been waiting for their food. Similarly, these WODs are on a time limit and you have to make sure that your program is correct and it runs properly before turning it in. In addition, any mistakes on the way will drag you closer and closer to that time limit. I feel like the WODs will help me because it tests my abilities to work under pressure and also simulate actual coding problems in real-world interviews. Overall, I like these WODs because it's a good way to get you used to working under pressure.
