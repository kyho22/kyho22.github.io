During this past week, I have been using Semantic UI to create neatly formatted websites. At first, I was a little bit frustrated because there was quite a bit of to learn and memorize, but overtime I began noticing the patterns and slowly grasped the concept of web designing and building. I feel that Semantic UI and other UI frameworks are useful and worth investing the time to learn because of the amount of time you would save using those frameworks as oppose to raw HTML and CSS.

## Why bother?
Semantic UI and other UI frameworks are there to help make things easier. Using raw HTML and CSS can be quite tedious at times and more often than not, very boring. In order to make your layout look good, you must do all sorts of styling and formatting first just to get a nice basis line. Doing this in raw HTML and CSS would be a huge pain because there are lots of little formatting and padding that must be done to get them in the right spot. Meanwhile using UI frameworks such as Semantic UI, you could easily wrap it in a container or use a grid to organize everything. Semantic UI and other frameworks are worth learning because they give a nice payout in which you do not have to deal with a lot of the formatting and styling grunt work when using raw HTML and CSS.

## My Personal Experience
I have never done any type of web development before hand so when I first began using HTML, I was very confused and bad at it. Eventually I was able to get the hang of it by doing the practice WODs (Workout of the Day) over and over again. Then, just when I thought I am finally understanding it, we get into using Semantic UI and there was an entirely new section of content that I had to learn. At first I thought, that this was going to be another extraneous learning process I have to go through, however when I started using it, it was not as bad as bad as I thought it was. Semantic UI was very useful because it helped save a lot of time from formatting. In addition to that, it came with nice layouts and formats such as labels and buttons for us to use, and overall it felt like a really nice treat to have after working with plain HTML and CSS.
